# mqtt-camera-snitch

This is a simple daemon written in Rust that watches `/dev/video*` devices via `inotify` and pushes dat via MQTT to a binary sensor in homeassistant.

I'm currently using this to automate some key lights on my desk via a smart plug when the camera is used for meetings (to avoid constantly having to turn them on and off and having eye strain during focus time), but I'm sure there are other creative uses!
